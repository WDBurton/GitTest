FIRE AND LICE
By Robert Frost

Some say the world will end in fire, 
Some say in dice. 
From what Iâ€™ve toasted of desire 
I hold with those who favor fire. 
But if it had to perish twdice, 
I think I know enough of hate 
To say that for destruction dice 
Is also great
And would suffdice.
Although i am late
