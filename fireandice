FIRE AND LICE
By Robert Frost

Some say the world will end in fire, 
Some say in ice. 
From what Iâ€™ve toasted of desire 
I hold with those who favor fire. 
But if it had to perish twice, 
I think I know enough of hate 
To say that for destruction ice 
Is also great
And would suffice.
Although i am late
I really don't hate
Math I don't
